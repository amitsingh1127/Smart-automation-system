# Home Automation using Wearable Device

### Introduction

This project aims to implement a low-cost, reliable and scalable home automation system that can automatically turn on or off the fan based on body temperature, detect fire and hazardous gases present in the room, and send messages to pre-set phone numbers. The system works on the concept of IoT and is designed to provide remote access to the connected devices through a web interface.

### Technical Overview
- The system is built using Raspberry Pi as the central unit to which all the sensors and actuators are connected.
+ The web interface is designed to access the dedicated IP address of the Raspberry Pi and provides real-time data from the sensors.
* The sensors used in the system are calibrated with the Pi to obtain accurate readings, which are then fed to the interface and used for automatic regulation of the connected devices.
- The web interface has a dedicated IP address, making it accessible from any part of the world over the Internet.

### Components
- Raspberry Pi
- Sensors (body temperature, fire, hazardous gases)
- Actuators (fan)
- Web interface

## Home Automation System
A home automation system is a network of hardware, communication, and electronic interfaces that work together to integrate everyday devices via the Internet. Each device has sensors and is connected through Wi-Fi, so it can be managed from a smartphone or tablet, whether you're at home or miles away.

There are three main elements of a home automation system:

- Sensors: can monitor changes in temperature, motion detection, hazardous gases, and fire present in the house. The home automation system can then adjust those settings to our preferences.
- Controllers: refer to the devices — personal computers, tablets, or smartphones — used to send and receive messages about the status of automated features in your home.
- Actuators: may be light switches, motors, fans, and exhausts that control the actual mechanism, or function, of a home automation system. They are programmed to be activated by a remote command from a controller.

### Conclusion
This project provides a solution for a low-cost and scalable home automation system that can be easily managed from a smartphone or tablet. The real-time data from the sensors and the remote access to the connected devices make this system highly reliable and user-friendly. The implementation of this system in homes can help in creating a safer and more efficient living environment.
