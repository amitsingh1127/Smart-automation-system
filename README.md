# Smart-automation-system
The main objective of this project is to implement a low-cost, reliable and scalable home automation system that can automatically on or off the fan according to the body temperature, detect fire and hazardous gases present in the room and also send messages to the pre-set phone number.
This project works on the concept of IoT. All the devices are connected centrally to the pi.
The web interface is designed to access the dedicated IP address of the Raspberry Pi to gain remote access over the devices directly connected to the RaspberryPi. The sensors are calibrated with the Pi to obtain the real-time data which is then fed to the interface as well as used for automatic regulation of the connected devices. 
The web interface having its dedicated IP address makes it accessible from any part of the world over the Internet.
Home automation is a network of hardware, communication, and electronic interfaces that work to integrate everyday devices via the Internet. Each device has sensors and is connected through Wi-Fi, so we can manage them from our smartphone or tablet whether you’re at home, or miles away. 
There are three main elements of a home automation system: sensors, controllers, and actuators.
Sensors can monitor changes in temperature, motion detection, hazardous gases, and fire present in the house. Home automation systems can then adjust those settings to our preferences.
•	Controllers refer to the devices — personal computers, tablets, or smartphones — used to send and receive messages about the status of automated features in your home.
•	Actuators may be light switches, motors, fans, and exhaust that control the actual mechanism, or function, of a home automation system. They are programmed to be activated by a remote command from a controller.
